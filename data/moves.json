Do so in quick, pop-like motions.Flex the muscles in your arms, legs, or torso (sometimes simultaneously) and grind your shoulders, then pause and remain in place for a specific amount of time, thereby "locking" it. For example, you may opt to bend your arms at your elbows, holding your hands in the air. Lock it.Count to three (or other designated time) to the music, then pop into another position, locking it again.",
